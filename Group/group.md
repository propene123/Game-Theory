# Second Price Sealed Bid Auctions
Second price sealed bid auctions are similar to the previous example but as the name
suggests have a key difference, the winner of the auction only pays the second highest
bid. This sounds counter-intuitive however if you've ever used E-Bay before then you
have participated in such an auction, with the only difference being you can see the
current winning bid. This type of auction has a very nice property in that truth-telling
is a dominant strategy, this means that always bidding the amount that you personally value
the item at is always the best strategy for you regardless of whether other players over or
under bid. Such a property makes this a very nice and fair kind of auction to partake in
as no one can gain an advantage over anyone else by employing a complex strategy. This also
produces a very clean and simple pure nash equilbrium in which all players bid their valuations
as since every players action is dominant then this must be a nash equilbrium as any other bid
will give a payoff less than or equal to bidding the valuation.
