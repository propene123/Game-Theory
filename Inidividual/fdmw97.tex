\section*{Exercise 1}
\section*{Exercise 2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item When $n$ is very large $R$ is approaching $r$
	\item
	Let $B$ be the set of all bids i.e. 
	\[B=\left\{b_1,b_2,...,b_{n-1},b_n \right\}\]
	Where $b_i$ is the bid of player $i \in [1,n]$.
	The maximum bid $\max(B)$ is $b_n$ as $b_n > r > 1$ by the problem definition.
	Therefore $R=E[\max(B\setminus\{b_n\})]$ i.e. the expected maximum of all bids less than $b_n$.
	\[
	\text{Let}\ B'=B\setminus\{b_n\}
	\]
	So $R=E[\max(B')]$, if any $b\in B'$ bids $r$ then $\max(B')$ is necessarily $r$ as $r>1$ as per the problem definition, else $\max(B')$ is $1$.\\
	We can now model $B'$ using a binomial distribution $B(n-1, 0.5)$ where a success is bidder $b_i$ bidding $r$. Let $X\sim B(n-1,0.5)$ be a discrete random variable representing the number of successes in $n-1$ bidders.
	\begin{align*}
		P(X\geq 1) &= 1-P(X=0) \\
		&= 1-\binom{n-1}{0}\times0.5^0\times0.5^{n-1} \\
		&= 1-0.5^{n-1}
	\end{align*}
This gives the probability that at least $1$ bidder from $B'$ bids $r$ therefore by taking the limit to infinity we can determine $R$ for very large $n$.
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty}  P(x\geq 1) = \lim_{n \to \infty} 1-0.5^{n-1} = 1-0 = 1
\]
This means as $n$ approaches $\infty$, $P(\max(B')=r)=1$ and $P(\max(B')=1)=0$ therefore
\[
	E[\max(B')]=1\times r + 0 \times 1 = r
\]
so $R=E[\max(B')] = r$
\end{enumerate}

	\item
	$\text{Solution}=(B,W)$\\
	Using backwards induction first we consider the subgames of length $1$, starting with the subgame following $B$. In this game Alice's optimal choice is $W$ giving a payoff of $1>0$. Next we consider the subgame following $C$. In this game Alice's optimal choice is $J$ giving a payoff of $2>0$. Now both subgames of length $1$ have been studied we can study the subgames of length $2$ of which there is only $1$ the full game. Given the optimal actions in the subgames of $1$  Mary choosing $B$ would yield her a payoff of $2$ and choosing $C$would yield a payoff of $1$, therefore Mary's optimal action is choosing $B$. No subgames exist of length $3$ therefore we are done producing the strategy pair $(B,WJ)$ and solution of $(B,W)$.

\section*{Exercise 4}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Item $1$ has final price of $k-1$ all other items $\{2,...,k\}$ have prices of $0$. Buyer $x_i$ buys item $1$ at a price of $k-1$ for a payoff of $k-(k-1)=1$.
	\item
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
		For all items indexed $i\in [2,k]$ the payoff for $x_i$ will always be 0 as the valuation is $0$ and so is the asking price.
		\item
		So long as $>1$ buyer $x_i$ has a $>0$ payoff from item $1$ there will be a constricted set $S$ with $N(S)=\{1\}$ as all other items will give payoff of 0 rather than $>0$ from item $1$. This results in the asking price of item $1$ being increased by $1$.
		\item
		As there are $k$ buyers with valuations for item $1$ of $k-i+1$ the maximum valuation is $x_i$ with $k$ and the second highest is $x_2$ with $k-1$. So by the time item $1$'s price has increased to $k-2$ all other buyers have either a negative payoff from item $1$ or $0$ in the case of $x_3$. Therefore all $x_i\notin \{x_1,x_2\}$ can be assigned to an item $\neq1$, of which there must be enough as there are $k-1$ such items and $k-2$ buyers $\notin \{x_1,x_2\}$. Now item $1$ increases its price to $k-1$ as $x_1$ and $x_2$ still form a constricted set $S$. After this increase $x_2$'s payoff is now $0$, so can be assigned to an item $\neq1$. Now there is no longer a constricted set $S$ so the final price of item $1$ is $k-1$ and all other items are $0$.
	\end{itemize}
	\item
	In this case the construction of market clearing prices models a second-price sealed-bid auction.
